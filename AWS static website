## 3. Configure Route 53 DNS Settings

### Create a Hosted Zone:
1. Navigate to the [Route 53 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/).
2. Click **Hosted zones**, then **Create hosted zone**.
3. Enter your domain name (`projectsbyyou.click`) and select **Public hosted zone**.
4. Click **Create hosted zone**.

### Update Name Servers:
- In the hosted zone details, note the **NS (Name Server)** records.
- If your domain is registered outside AWS, update the domain's name servers to match these NS records.
- If registered with AWS, this step is handled automatically.

### Create DNS Records:

#### A Record for Root Domain:
1. Click **Create record**.
2. Set **Record name** to leave blank (represents the root domain).
3. Choose **Record type** as `A ‚Äì IPv4 address`.
4. Select **Alias** as `Yes`.
5. For **Alias target**, enter your S3 website endpoint (e.g., `projectsbyyou.click.s3-website-region.amazonaws.com`).
6. Click **Create records**.

#### A Record for www Subdomain:
1. Click **Create record**.
2. Set **Record name** to `www`.
3. Repeat the same steps as above, setting the alias target to the same S3 endpoint.

## 4. Test the Website
- Open a web browser and navigate to:
  - `http://projectsbyyou.click`
  - `http://www.projectsbyjayla.click`
- You should see your static website's content.

## 5. Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN:
- Ensure that the domain is correctly registered and that the name servers are properly set.

### NoSuchKey Error:
- Verify that the `index.html` file is correctly named and uploaded to the S3 bucket.

### Access Denied:
- Check the bucket policy to ensure public read access is granted.
### Links
- Don't forget to add your social link in the HTML file.
